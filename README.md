# Zowdow Autosuggest Service

Â© 2015-2017 Zowdow, Inc.

The Zowdow Autosuggest service is intended to provide application developers with a new opportunity to monetize in the search autosuggest space.

We offer a robust, micro-SDK for Android that is currently deployed across distribution partners like Dolphin & SmartSearch.

In addition, we also provide an API that can be called directly from your app.

For both integration methods the application developer will require an app-id key. You can request an app-id key by sending an email to dev@zowdow.com.
